AD-HOC ON DEMAND DISTANCE VECTOR:

1. Introduction
The Python code provided aims to simulate the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol within a wireless ad-hoc network. AODV is particularly well-suited for dynamic networks where nodes may enter or leave spontaneously, making it a relevant protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs).

2. Code Components
2.1 AODVNode Class:
The AODVNode class represents an individual node in the ad-hoc network. It encompasses essential functionalities for AODV, including:

Initialization of routing tables.
Distance updating mechanisms.
Route discovery initiation.
Handling Route Request (RREQ) and Route Reply (RREP) messages.
Displaying the routing table.

2.2 generate_connected_graph Function:
The generate_connected_graph function creates a connected Watts-Strogatz graph to serve as the underlying model for the ad-hoc network. This graph generation method ensures a small-world topology, contributing to the realism of the simulation.

2.3 visualize_graph Function:
The visualize_graph function utilizes the NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries to visually represent the generated graph. This visualization aids in understanding the structure of the simulated ad-hoc network.

2.4 simulate_aodv Function:
The simulate_aodv function orchestrates the overall simulation process. It involves:

Node initialization and graph setup.
Simulation of the AODV route discovery process from a specified source to a destination node.
Displaying routing tables before and after the simulation.

3. Simulation Flow
The simulation follows a structured flow:

Node Initialization: Nodes are created, each with its routing table and graph attributes.
Graph Generation: A connected Watts-Strogatz graph is generated to model the ad-hoc network topology.
Visualization: The graph is visualized using NetworkX and Matplotlib.

AODV Simulation: The AODV simulation is initiated from a source node to a destination node.
Route Discovery: Route discovery is simulated through the exchange of RREQ and RREP messages.
Display Results: Routing tables are displayed before and after the simulation.

4. Simulation Details
Nodes initiate route discovery through RREQ broadcasts.
RREQ messages propagate through the network.
Routing tables are updated upon receiving RREQ messages.
RREP messages are sent back, finalizing the route discovery process.
Delays are introduced to simulate transmission and processing times, enhancing realism.
5. Usage
Example usage is provided in the code, demonstrating the generation of a connected graph, visualization, and AODV route discovery from Node 0 to Node 7.

6. Conclusion
In conclusion, this AODV simulation code provides a comprehensive and structured approach to understanding the dynamics of AODV route discovery in wireless ad-hoc networks. The code, while serving as a starting point, offers flexibility for customization and extension to cater to specific simulation requirements.
